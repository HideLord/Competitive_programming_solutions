# 1. Domino field (Broken profile DP)
You are give a field NxM. Find the number of ways you could fill the field with dominos (2x1 or 1x2 objects) without leaving empty spaces. Output the answer modulo 1000000007.

# 2. Extender gcd
Given two numbers a,b and two ranges [l1,r1] & [l2,r2], find the number of solutions which satisfy the equation a*x + b*y=gcd(a,b) such that x is in the first range and y is in the second range. x and y should be integers. l1,r1,l2,r2 < <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{18}" title="10^{18}" />

# 3. Fibonacci matrix (matrix multiplication)
Given an index n, find the nth fibonacci number modulo 1000000007

# 4. Expected path length
Given an acyclic undirected tree and two of its vertice a and b, find the expected path length under this condition:
If there is a path between a and b, then the probability that you travel from a to b is the weight of the edge over the sum of all other edges comming out of a.
